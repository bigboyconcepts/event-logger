bugs
- sometimes events are added to the list without them actually happening(Headphone plugged, volume level changed, orientation changed)
- media play/pause works only on limited number of players
- when app is killed by the system due to low memory (on android 4.4) it doesn't get restarted - only happens on 4.4+

todo
- lock app
- for app events, show app icon
