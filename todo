bugs
- sometimes events are added to the list without them actually happening(Headphone plugged, volume level changed, orientation changed)
- list sometimes doesn't scroll to bottom when app is started
- filter doesn't work yet
- settings menu is there but it doesn't do anything at the moment
- help item is there but it does nothing yet
- media play/pause works only on limited number of players
- when app is killed by the system due to low memory (on android 4.4) it doesn't get restarted - only happens on 4.4+
